/- The comparison routes through the coefficient `List`, not the `Array`:
`Array.instDecidableEq` delegates its nonempty case to the non-`@[expose]`
`Array.instDecidableEqImpl`, whose body is unavailable downstream under the
module system, so `decide`/`rfl` on `DensePoly` equalities would get stuck
(see `progress/lean4-array-decidableeq-module-repro.md`, fixed upstream by
leanprover/lean4#14270). `List` equality is fully exposed and kernel-reduces.

This specialization is owned here so `hex-poly` remains dependency-free until
the upstream fix lands. -/
