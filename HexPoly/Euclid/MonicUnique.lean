Uniqueness of monic (Euclidean) division for `DensePoly` over a commutative ring.

`divMod_eq_of_reconstruction` says any reconstruction `q * g + r = num` with a
positive-degree divisor `g` whose leading coefficient is a two-sided unit for the
`Div`/`Mul` structure and with remainder of degree below `g` must be `divMod num g`.
This is the ring-hom-free counterpart of `Polynomial.div_modByMonic_unique`; the
proof reduces the difference of two reconstructions to a single division that is
simultaneously `(quotient-difference, 0)` (via `divMod_eq_of_polynomial_mul`) and
`(0, remainder-difference)` (via the degree short circuit), forcing both to vanish.
